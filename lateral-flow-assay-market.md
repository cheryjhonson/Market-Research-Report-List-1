<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Assay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Assays</li><li>Competitive Assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lateral flow assay market encompasses two primary types: sandwich assays and competitive assays. Sandwich assays detect analytes by binding them between two antibodies, producing a visible signal, commonly used for infectious disease detection and biomarker analysis. In contrast, competitive assays measure the presence of analytes through a displacement mechanism, where the target competes with a labeled counterpart, useful for testing substances like drugs and hormones. Both types offer rapid results, making them popular in diagnostics and point-of-care testing applications.</p></p>
