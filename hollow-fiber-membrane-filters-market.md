<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Fiber Membrane Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microfiltration</li><li>Ultrafiltration</li><li>Nanofiltration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow fiber membrane filters are categorized into three main types based on pore size and filtration capability. Microfiltration (MF) removes larger particles, such as bacteria and suspended solids, offering a physical barrier for pre-treatment processes. Ultrafiltration (UF) targets smaller solutes, including proteins and viruses, providing a more refined purification. Nanofiltration (NF) operates on an even finer scale, effectively separating divalent ions and small organic molecules, making it ideal for water softening and desalination applications. Each type serves distinct industrial and water treatment needs.</p></p>
